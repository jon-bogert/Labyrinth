Instructions:

You have been assigned a number of items to collect that are scattered throughout the labyrinth and you must collect them in order.
Every turn, you may use the extra maze tile to move one row or column of the maze by 1 tile. The restrictions are, you can only
place the items where the arrows around the labyrinth are, and you may not directly undo the last move.
Once you have collected all your pieces, head back to your starting tile to finish!
